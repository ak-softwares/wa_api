  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/animations/
    - assets/images/social_media_logo/
    - assets/images/default_images/
    - assets/images/payment_logo/
    - assets/images/banners/
    - assets/images/youtube_banner/
    - assets/images/setup_logos/
    - assets/logos/
    - assets/icons/brands/
    - assets/icons/categories/
    - assets/images/whatsapp/
    - assets/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf
    - assets/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Bold.ttf
    - assets/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf
    - assets/fonts/times-new-roman/times.ttf
    - assets/fonts/times-new-roman/times-new-roman-bold.ttf
    - assets/sounds/whatsapp/
    - shorebird.yaml
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: Poppins
     fonts:
       - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Light.ttf
         weight: 300
       - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
         weight: 400
       - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Italic.ttf
         style: italic
       - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf
         weight: 500
       - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-MediumItalic.ttf
         weight: 400
         style: italic
       - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
         weight: 600
       - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf
         weight: 800
